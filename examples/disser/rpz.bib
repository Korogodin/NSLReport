abstract = {Abstract With the completion of the experimental and regional phases, China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) is being speedily expanded to a global and multifunctional satellite navigation system, BDS III. Confronted with challenges such as limited frequency resources and diversified user requirements, new signals with novel modulation techniques are adopted in BDS III. In addition to the legacy B1I and B3I signals, new open service signals, B1C and B2a/B2b, as well as some new authorized service signals, will be broadcast by BDS III satellites. Among them, B1C and B2a are compatible and interoperable with GPS and Galileo. The modulation techniques and the detailed signal structures of B1C and B2a are introduced in this paper, along with analysis of the initial in-orbit test results of the new signals.},

abstract = {Abstract Clock synchronization is critical for synchronous pseudolite systems. Wireless synchronization methods are desirable for their flexibility in system deployment, and most of them build a tree topology of time information flow based on master-slave synchronization between pseudolites. A slave pseudolite can receive signals broadcast by multiple pseudolites; however, existing methods usually utilize one signal and ignore others in which the time information could improve synchronization precision and reliability. We present a mesh topology based clock synchronization (MTCS) technique by utilizing all received signals. MTCS builds a mesh topology of time information flow, which can keep synchronization in case of link interruption or pseudolite failure. The coupling relationship of slave clocks is derived, and the influence of measurement biases is analyzed. As shown by both analysis and simulations, MTCS has better clock synchronization precision. When link interruption or pseudolite failures occur, MTCS is more robust than tree topology based methods.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The road to the signals Galileo has today as a baseline has been tedious and long, but has followed a logic from the start. From the very beginning, one of the main challenges that Galileo set for itself was to offer three wide band signals, satisfying the requirements of mass market and pushing the potential performance to its natural limits. The historical Agreement of 2004 between the US and the EC impacted the initially planned signals but has intensified the cooperation between Galileo and GPS. The final touch to the Galileo signal plan was achieved in 2006 when the Working Group on GPS and Galileo Compatibility and Interoperability finally agreed upon the great interest in a new modulation for the E1/L1 frequency, namely the Multiplex Binary Offset Carrier. Galileo has thus accomplished the original objective of providing three wide band signals for the civilian GNSS community.},
